  You have a unique contribution to make to humanity, and donâ€™t let anyone
  convince you otherwise. This is why you think differently. This is why your
  life experiences have been different. This is why you feel differently. You
  need to honor this uniqueness and believe in yourself. Your ancestors are not
  fools. You are where you are for a reason. They are leading you down a
  particular path for a reason. Be open and willing to do what you have been
  inspired to do.
