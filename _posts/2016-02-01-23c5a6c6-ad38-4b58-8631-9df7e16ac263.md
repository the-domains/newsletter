You have a unique contribution to make to humanity, and
don't let anyone convince you otherwise.This is why you think differently. This is why your life experiences have been different. This is why you feel differently. You need to honor this uniqueness and believe
in yourself. Your ancestors are not
fools. You are where you are for a
reason. They are leading you down a
particular path for a reason. Be open
and willing to do what you have been inspired to do.
