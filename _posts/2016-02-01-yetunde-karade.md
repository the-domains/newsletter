# Yetunde Karade

Yetunde Karade is a talented creative writer who enjoys
using her skills to create written products, i.e., fliers, announcements,
newsletters, etc., as well as short stories, essays and poems.

Winning a short story contest early in the 3rd
grade, she excelled in written expression throughout school, finding it easier
and more comfortable to express herself in writing than the usual speaking-in-front-of-the-classroom
assignments and group activities.It was
then that she knew she wanted to become a writer.Inspired by this childhood dream, she went on
to pursue and complete her B.A. in English in 2001, and plans to further her
studies, enrolling in an MFA writing program in the near future.Especially gifted in arranging and
choreographing concepts in spirituality & shamanism, you can view a portion
of her work in the 2010-2015 archived newsletters section on [www.malidoma.com][0].

Yetunde has traveled to Burkina Faso, Brazil and Ghana,
heeding the call to deepen her connection to the Divine as she walks the path
of spirituality.She was initiated as a
Yoruba priestess of Yemoja in 2004.In
2008 she completed a two-year training program in Indigenous African Spirit
Technologies (IAST), conducted and led by Malidoma Patrice Somé and Alwyn
Thomas.Additionally, she also underwent
and completed a three-year Dagara-inspired Elder Initiation (also led and
conducted by, Dr. Somé) becoming an Initiated Elder in 2015\.

Yetunde finds great joy in being and working in community ---a dynamic leader of ritual ceremonies, she
loves engaging in sacred traditional practices and she shines in leading
and bringing others to inner healing and transformation via ritual.Correspondingly, she is arranging and putting
pieces together for a memoir, highlighting her experiences of her spiritual
journey and related travels.
