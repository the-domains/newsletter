_Ask Alwyn!_

Is our
newsletter feature in the next and subsequent issues that will allow readers to
become active participants in our growing online community. Send your inquiries to Alwyn concerning
in-depth issues of Spirit Technology knowledge and information and real application
for daily, modern living.

Send your question to [askalwyn@thespirittech.com][0]. Alwyn will choose and respond to one
questions per newsletter. The question
and the response will be posted anonymously, unless you request otherwise. He will most likely respond to the questions
with the widest appeal to the community, or the question that is most
frequently asked so that all can benefit from the information he has to
share. Alwyn is eager to read and
respond to questions on the following: discovering your gifts and purpose, the benefits of using Spirit
Technology to solve problems, the role of modern-day shamanism, ritual &
community, nature, etc.

Space to respond is limited, so please focus on asking
questions that will serve the greater good of the community and not questions
on Alwyn's personal and private life. Please understand that no matter how important you feel your question
is, Alwyn cannot answer every question.

We are excited about this opportunity to connect with you, and
we invite your participation in helping us to create, maintain and sustain our
budding online community. Please write
to [newsletter@thespirittech.com][1] with any questions
you may have.
