# Reclaiming Spirituality as Technology 

## Introduction

Shamanism, is considered the oldest known form of
spirituality. If that is so, all other types of worship and/or religious
services might begin here. This information is relevant in today's society,
because many people have become entrenched in science and/or technology as it
pertains to consumerism,
i.e., computers, cells phones, digital TVs, e-books and the like. These are
miraculous and wondrous inventions to be sure, however, they do nothing to feed
the soul nor do they promote spiritual growth or healing. More often than not,
materialistic technology blocks the path that one would take to grow closer to
nature, their spiritual path or the fundamental truths of their authentic
selves. In fact, this technology often causes a disconnection between humans
and their soul, i.e., genuine spiritual pursuits.

However, still quite a few individuals refuse to live free
of the ancient ways. They are seekers with a hunger in their souls that drives
them to search for meaning in all things, connect with nature, and appreciate
all forms of life (human, animal, plant, heavenly and/or terrestrial). These
individuals view spirituality as a bridge that links, rather than divides,
other spiritual or religious practices that differs from their own. For
instance, if one is a Christian, s/he can also practice ancient forms of
worship and/or be called to live the life of a Shaman or other ancient
spiritual practices.

## Today's Technology

In just ten years, monumental advances in machinery, human
skills, knowledge, tool making, and equipment has taken place filling the world
with gadgets of every conceivable type, kind, size, and color; not to mention
the technology that was created prior to the 21st century
(electricity, telephones, indoor plumbing, etc.) which continues to affect our
lives. Technology changes the way we live, how we view the world, and perceive
the people in it; in other words, it alters our perceptions and changes how we
interact with the environment and/or what we believe makes it thrive. For
instance, many people find meaning through the spiritual world, communing with
nature, and forming human connections with family/friends/acquaintances rather
than through the connection of a cell phone or other gadgets. Face-to-face
connections are becoming more frayed and frazzled as materialistic technology
continues to grow. However, as we move forward, we might consider another type
of technology that allows the spiritual self to emerge.

## Spiritual Technology 

Ancient or indigenous practices are used to bring
spirituality to the forefront with tools and techniques to make life better for
yourself and those around you. As a practitioner, you'll be able to augment
your problem solving skills, heal self and others and improve the quality of
your life and those around you with native technology. As with technology in
general, spiritual technology also has tools, such as, clothing, instruments,
herbs, medicines, etc., that are used to carry out their specific rituals
and/or practices to raise individual consciousness.The goal is to become self-aware, more authentic
and get in touch with the spirit world. Once you open yourself up to the
ancient ways, you'll learn to rely less on what the external world has to offer
and start to become more self-reliant. As you continue to grow, you learn to
recognize what's real and/or what's merely created by the materialism and
consumerism that governs our country. Spiritual Technology gives you the chance
to bridge the knowledge of the modern world with that of the ancients through
meditation, music, clothing, herbs, plants and medicine.
