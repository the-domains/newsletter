            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Reclaiming Spirituality as Technology </h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Shamanism, is considered the oldest known form of
spirituality. If that is so, all other types of worship and/or religious
services might begin here. This information is relevant in today’s society,
because many people have become entrenched in science and/or technology as it
pertains to consumerism,
i.e., computers, cells phones, digital TVs, e-books and the like. These are
miraculous and wondrous inventions to be sure, however, they do nothing to feed
the soul nor do they promote spiritual growth or healing. More often than not,
materialistic technology blocks the path that one would take to grow closer to
nature, their spiritual path or the fundamental truths of their authentic
selves. In fact, this technology often causes a disconnection between humans
and their soul, i.e., genuine spiritual pursuits.</p></article>]]></description>
