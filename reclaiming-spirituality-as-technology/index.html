If that is so, all other types of worship and/or religious services might begin here. This information is relevant in todayâ€™s society, because many people have become entrenched in science and/or technology as it pertains to consumerism, i.e., computers, cells phones, digital TVs, e-books and the like. These are miraculous and wondrous inventions to be sure, however, they do nothing to feed the soul nor do they promote spiritual growth or healing. More often than not, materialistic technology blocks the path that one would take to grow closer to nature, their spiritual path or the fundamental truths of their authentic selves. In fact, this technology often causes a disconnection between humans and their soul, i.e., genuine spiritual pursuits.</p><p>However, still quite a few individuals refuse to live free of the ancient ways. They are seekers with a hunger in their souls that drives them to search for meaning in all things, connect with nature, and appreciate all forms of life (human, animal, plant, heavenly and/or terrestrial). These individuals view spirituality as a bridge that links, rather than divides, other spiritual or religious practices that differs from their own. For instance, if one is a Christian, s/he can also practice ancient forms of worship and/or be called to live the life of a Shaman or other ancient spiritual practices.</p><h2>Todayâ€™s Technology</h2><p>In just ten years, monumental advances in machinery, human skills, knowledge, tool making, and equipment has taken place filling the world with gadgets of every conceivable type, kind, size, and color; not to mention the technology that was created prior to the 21<sup>st</sup> century (electricity, telephones, indoor plumbing, etc.) which continues to affect our lives. Technology changes the way we live, how we view the world, and perceive the people in it; in other words, it alters our perceptions and changes how we interact with the environment and/or what we believe makes it thrive. For instance, many people find meaning through the spiritual world, communing with nature, and forming human connections with family/friends/acquaintances rather than through the connection of a cell phone or other gadgets. Face-to-face connections are becoming more frayed and frazzled as materialistic technology continues to grow. However, as we move forward, we might consider another type of technology that allows the spiritual self to emerge.</p><h2>Spiritual Technology </h2><p>Ancient or indigenous practices are used to bring spirituality to the forefront with tools and techniques to make life better for yourself and those around you. As a practitioner, youâ€™ll be able to augment your problem solving skills, heal self and others and improve the quality of your life and those around you with native technology. As with technology in general, spiritual technology also has tools, such as, clothing, instruments, herbs, medicines, etc., that are used to carry out their specific rituals and/or practices to raise individual consciousness.The goal is to become self-aware, more authentic and get in touch with the spirit world. Once you open yourself up to the ancient ways, youâ€™ll learn to rely less on what the external world has to offer and start to become more self-reliant. As you continue to grow, you learn to recognize whatâ€™s real and/or what's merely created by the materialism and consumerism that governs our country. Spiritual Technology gives you the chance to bridge the knowledge of the modern world with that of the ancients through meditation, music, clothing, herbs, plants and medicine. </p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="53"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="55"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="56"><span data-reactid="57"><!-- react-empty: 58 --><h2 data-reactid="59"><a data-reactid="60">SpirtTech Community News</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="61"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="63"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="64"></div></section></div></div>
